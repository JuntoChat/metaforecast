This market will resolve to “Yes” if an executive order is issued by the Governor of Texas which mandates the use of a face covering over the nose and mouth when inside a commercial entity or other building or space open to the public, or when in an outdoor public space, and “No” otherwise. If such a mandate does not apply to some limited subset of people or cases (e.g. people younger than 10, any person with medical conditions that prevent wearing face covering, while eating, while exercising outdoors, as with the previous mask mandate), this market will still resolve to “Yes”. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC). As a general principle, this market will resolve to “Yes” if Texas implements any mask mandate that is substantially similar to the July 2, 2020 Texas Mask Mandate (Executive Order 29), which requires most people to wear masks in public most of the time (https://open.texas.gov/uploads/files/organization/opentexas/EO-GA-29-use-of-face-coverings-during-COVID-19-IMAGE-07-02-2020.pdf).
