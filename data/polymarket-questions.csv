Neither Marjorie Taylor Greene, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @mtgreenee will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.

Should the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.

In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).","[{""name"":""Less than 80"",""probability"":""0.3405166665208588557030405261550704"",""type"":""PROBABILITY""},{""name"":""81-95"",""probability"":""0.2069257779675633066754996274438289"",""type"":""PROBABILITY""},{""name"":""96-110"",""probability"":""0.1634832414861564553275933427922908"",""type"":""PROBABILITY""},{""name"":""111-125"",""probability"":""0.1235110987017487763250162114444212"",""type"":""PROBABILITY""},{""name"":""126-140"",""probability"":""0.08248548304886138067830916935318297"",""type"":""PROBABILITY""},{""name"":""More than 140"",""probability"":""0.08307773227481122529054112281120574"",""type"":""PROBABILITY""}]","81",,4
