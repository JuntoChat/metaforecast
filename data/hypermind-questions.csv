"What will be the year-over-year growth rate of U.S. Nominal GDP in Q4 2022?","https://prod.hypermind.com/ngdp/en/showcase/showcase.html","Hypermind","[]","This question compares 2022:Q4 to 2021:Q4. 
The 'answer' to this question will be based on the advance estimate of nominal GDP growth in 2022:Q4, which will be published in 2023:Q1.
All of the information used to calculate the growth rate will appear in the BEA website, Table 1.1.5, line 1:
[https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=2#reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&1921=survey](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=2#reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&1921=survey)
The growth rate will be calculated using the latest estimates of both 2022:Q4 and 2021:Q4 nominal GDP:
Growth Rate (%) = 100 * (2022:Q4/2021:Q4 - 1)
Note that the nominal GDP growth rate is expressed as a percentage (not decimal.) It is then rounded off to the nearest tenth of a percent.
Finally, beware that the 2021:Q4 estimate that will be used in the calculation is the revised estimate that will be published along with the release of the 2022:Q14estimate.

"When will at least 45 U.S. states (incl. Washington D.C.) have had no measures for workplace closures for a full week?","https://prod.hypermind.com/ngdp/en/showcase2/showcase.html?sc=Covid19","Hypermind","[]","This question will be settled according to the data compiled by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), using the subnational data in [OxCGRT's ""primary"" dataset](https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy).* 
The relevant data are [plotted and regularly updated](https://prod.hypermind.com/ngdp/en/OxCGRT.html) for easy reference. This question will resolve when the light-blue line (""no measures"") rises at 45 or more in the ""7 days average"" version of the graph.
If OxCGRT's primary dataset stops reporting these data before the question resolves, Hypermind might rely on other sources it deems most reliable and relevant to settle the question, for example OxCGRT's [secondary dataset](https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy) on USA subnational data, or another source that reports a statistic comparable to OxCGRT's current concept of ""no measures for workplace closures."" If no such source is available, this question might be suspended without ever being resolved.
*For this question, ""no measures for workplace closures"" will correspond to a 0 for the ""C2_Workplace closing"" variable, as described in the dataset's [codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md). For this question to resolve, it must be the case that for 7 days in a row, the ""C2_Workplace closing"" variable is set to 0 for at least 45 U.S. states (the STATE_TOTAL jurisdictions) or 44 U.S. states and Washington D.C..
