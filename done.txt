According to Good Judgment's Superforecasters, the\n      announcement is likely to come \"sooner rather than later,\" with a\n      statement around the 21-22 September, 2-3 November, or 14-15 December 2021\n      FOMC meeting the most likely outcome (currently 98% probability in total).<br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <span class=\"bold-title\">SUPERFORECASTER COMMENTARY HIGHLIGHTS:</span><br>\n      <br>\n      24 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>The next FOMC meeting after September is in\n        November--perhaps too late to allow lengthy notice prior to the start of\n        the taper.<br>\n      </em><br>\n      20 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>Based on Fed Chairman Powell's recent <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-powell-says-economy-a-ways-off-bond-taper-inflation-ease-2021-07-14/\" target=\"_blank\">remarks</a>\n        to Congress, increasing the probability of the \"between 23 September\n        2021 and 15 December 2021\" timeline. I would expect more remarks to\n        prepare the market if a QE tapering announcement were to be coming in\n        the next two months.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      19 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>Barclays is <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/07/15/what-does-the-federal-reserve-mean-when-it-talks-about-tapering/amp/\" target=\"_blank\">anticipating</a>\n        the Fed will begin tapering its asset purchases as soon as this year.\n        I'm leaning toward an announcement in September. Reason? They will want\n        to do tapering before they raise rates. If they announce in September,\n        they can work out the details in November and start soon thereafter.\n        They can then gauge the effect for a couple of quarters and by mid-2022\n        raise rates if inflation stays high.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      15 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>The high inflation data and low bond yields give\n        the Fed a golden opportunity to announce the intent to start tapering.\n        The taper itself should begin by the end of Q4. The timing of the\n        announcement is a little tricky. There may not be enough consensus to\n        make the announcement at the upcoming FOMC this month. Powell seemed <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/fed-s-bullard-urges-start-of-tapering-bonds-with-jobs-goals-met\" target=\"_blank\">tentative</a>\n        in comments this week. Bullard and others have been calling for taper.\n        However, as the next meeting after July is not until September, I also\n        don't think there is an upside in waiting until then (which could mean\n        two more months of bad inflation data without action, and perhaps cause\n        a backup in longer yields).</em><br>\n      <br>\n      14 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>Mary Daley <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-07-02/feds-daly-appropriate-to-consider-tapering-later-this-year\" target=\"_blank\">suggests</a>\n        the Fed should begin slowing bond purchases \"later this year or early\n        next.\" The Economist covers a possible <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/07/01/does-americas-hot-housing-market-still-need-propping-up\" target=\"_blank\">strategy</a>\n        for a reduction in purchases of mortgage backed assets.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      13 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>The headline inflation number will have to enter\n        into the Fed's calculations. \"Before 23 September 2021\" therefore\n        becomes more likely.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      13 Jul 21 - Comment: <em>Higher inflation number again today. More likely\n        now the Fed will announce early to prepare markets for the tapering next\n        year.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      30 Jun 21 - Comment: <em>It will happen, but when? Leaning a bit more to\n        the November meeting. They like to give the market a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-waller-says-he-would-not-rule-out-2022-rate-hike-2021-06-29/\" target=\"_blank\">long</a>\n        <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-debate-scaling-back-mortgage-bond-purchases-at-faster-clip-11624872602\" target=\"_blank\">heads-up</a>.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      19 Jun 21 - Comment: <em>Generally focusing on \"Before 23 September 2021\"\n        and \"Between 23 September 2021 and 15 December 2021\" for now, but there\n        may be a longer tail on this if inflation and recovery prove to be more\n        transitory.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      18 Jun 21 - Barclays moves <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/barclays-moves-up-expectations-for-fed-tapering-after-fomc-meeting-11623959423\" target=\"_blank\">up</a>\n      expectations for Fed tapering after FOMC meeting. Comment: <em>I expect\n        they will in September. Next <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4434721-fed-starting-campaign-to-taper-asset-purchases\" target=\"_blank\">meetings</a>\n        are 21-22 September and 2-3 November.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      17 Jun 21 - Comment: <em>It appears Powell wants to give 2-3 months'\n        advance notice. I don't see much reason for QE right now: asset prices\n        and credit risk appetite aren't the problem (as they were after\n        2008-09), but to a Fed economist with a hammer everything looks like a\n        nail. Economists may want to see what happens after extended\n        unemployment benefits run out in September. Whether Biden's budget\n        including many expansive new spending programs gets passed will also\n        have an impact on timing. I think early Q1 of next year is the likeliest\n        timeframe for tapering QE, which means an announcement probably in Q4 of\n        this year.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      16 Jun 21 - Comment: <em>Fed says first taper discussions started in\n        April. With the economy growing, inflation higher, increased reserves\n        interest rate at the central bank, taper is just a matter of time. More\n        important may be the initial decrease from the current purchase $120b in\n        Treasurys and MBS assets. Lower decreases over longer periods of time\n        (or even the extrapolation from a single data point) would be more\n        market-friendly. Perhaps the sooner the Fed announces a small reduction\n        in purchases, the sooner the market will get past the inevitable\n        overreaction to the reduced purchases. I expect the announcement will be\n        prior to year end.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      15 Jun 21 - Comment: <em>A lot of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-investors-are-watching-fed-taper-talk-inflation-2021-06-15/\" target=\"_blank\">coverage</a>\n        I'm seeing has the flavor of something like this <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-investors-are-watching-fed-taper-talk-inflation-2021-06-15/\" target=\"_blank\">happening</a>\n        sooner rather than later.</em><br>\n      <br>\n      14 Jun 21 - Comment: <em>Seems like early <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/the-federal-reserves-so-called-taper-talk-could-keep-markets-on-edge-through-the-summer.html\" target=\"_blank\">discussions</a>\n        in June and July will be followed by a strategy in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-could-pencil-in-earlier-rate-increase-at-meeting-11623663001\" target=\"_blank\">August</a>\n        and an announcement of tapering in the <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/poll-fed-to-announce-qe-taper-in-aug-or-sept-on-rising-inflation-concerns-2021-06-10\" target=\"_blank\">fall</a>--several\n        months in advance of when it is due to start--to minimize the impact on\n        markets.</em><em></em><em></em><br>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <hr> <br><center><input type=\"button\" id=\"btn1508\" style=\"font-size:14pt;background:#8a2535;color:white;border-radius:5px;\" value=\"Close Superforecaster Analysis\" onclick=\"showReport(1508);\"></center></div><br>"
